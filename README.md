SmartQR Order: Contactless Table Ordering Solution
SmartQR Order is an innovative, contactless table ordering system designed to enhance the dining experience by streamlining order placement and reducing wait times. Each table in your venue is assigned a unique QR code, which guests can scan using their smartphones to instantly access a digital menu and place orders directly from their seats.

Upon scanning the QR code, customers are directed to a personalized interface linked to their specific table. From there, they can browse the live menu, customize items, and submit their orders with just a few taps—no app download required. Orders are sent in real time to the kitchen or service staff, ensuring faster service and improved operational efficiency.
